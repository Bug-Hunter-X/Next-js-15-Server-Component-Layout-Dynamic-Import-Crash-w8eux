In Next.js 15, an uncommon error arises when using server components with dynamic imports within a layout.  If a dynamic import in the layout fails, it can cause the entire application to crash, even if the failing component isn't directly rendered on every page.  The error might manifest as a 500 Internal Server Error or a less descriptive runtime error, making it difficult to debug.  This is because the error in the layout component is not properly caught and handled within the server-side rendering process.
